    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>How do you make our Big Fat Greek Salad bigger and fatter? By adding garlic, lemon, and herb chicken and some crispy, crunchy, pan dripping-soaked potatoes. And yes, we could've called this Greek Chicken and Potato Salad, but it's come to my attention that these days, people really enjoy eating things called "bowls."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken thighs, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, cayenne, garlic, lemon juice, and 1/4 cup olive oil in a large mixing bowl. Toss very thoroughly to combine, making sure the chicken thighs are completely and evenly coated with the marinade.</li>
        <li>Wrap in plastic and marinate in the refrigerator for 6 to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and grease generously with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, halve potatoes lengthwise; slice each half into 3 equal pieces. Dice into cubes and set aside.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken thighs to the prepared sheet pan smooth-side up, spacing evenly. Reserve any excess marinade in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to the bowl the chicken was in, along with a splash of olive oil and a large pinch of salt. Toss well to coat evenly. Scatter potatoes onto the chicken and distribute as evenly as possible in between the chicken thighs to fill any empty spaces.</li>
    </ol>
